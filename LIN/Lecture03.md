## Phonetics Part II

### Vowels and Diphtongs
* there are two types of vowels
	* Simple
		* No noticeable change in quality during articulation
		* Put, Pat, Pet, Car
	* Complex
		* Exhibit a change in quality within a single syllable
		* Diphthongs, Change in vowel quality are due to tongue movement away
		  from the initial vowel articulation towards a glide position
* Features of a vowel
	* Height
		* High /i/ -- leak
		* Low /&#230;/ -- low
	* Front/Backness
		* Front /&#230;/ -- pat
		* Back /a/ -- pot
	* Tenseness/Laxness
		* Tense /i/ -- lead
		* Lax /I/ -- lid
	* Rounded/Unrounded	
		* Unrounded /i/ -- beat
		* Rounded /u/ -- boot
* Diphthongs
	* Starting and ending position of the vowel changes
	* /aj/ -- Bite
	* /oj/ -- Toy
	* /e/
	* go
		* [gow]
		* starts with o but ends on w.

## Describing Vowels
* Described using tongue position
	* High/low, front/back
* Front Vowels
	* [i] beet
	* [I] bit
	* [e] bait
	* [&#603;] bet
	* [&#230;] bat
* Back Vowels
	* [u] boot
	* [&#650;] put
	* [o] boat
	* [&#593;] bot
* Central Vowels
	* stressed: [&#652;] but/putt
	* unstressed: [&#601;] sof<b>a</b>/tel<b>e</b>phone
* Every vowel is a combination of 4 features

## Speech Production
* Coarticulation
	* As a result of multiple articulators, adjustments occur
	* Change the nature of individual segments
* Assimilation rule
	* Neighboring segments become more similar to one another
* Regressive Assimilation
	* A feature is transmitted to the preceeding vowel
	* ie bank the vowel gets nasalized because of the consonant infront of it
* Voicing Assimilation
	* Liquids and glides become voiceless after voiceless stops
	* Have to, Has to, Used to
* Assimilation in place of articulation
	* adding `in` at the front of words to create a negative meaning
* Dissimilation
	* Segment Deletion and insertion
		* parade - [p&#601;red] becomes [pred]
		* suppose - [s&#601;poz] becomes [spoz]
	* Segment insertion is called: **Epenthesis**
		* `warmth` [worm&#952;] becomes [wormp&#952;]
	* Moving phonemes around is called: **Metathesis**
		* `ask` [ask] becomes [aks]
