	* Classifications of the instruments in the modern orchestra
		* Strings
			* Instruments with taut strings attached to a sound box that
			  amplifies the sounds; pitch varied by length of the vibrating
			  strings; played with a bow or plucked/stummed
			* Barber, Adagio for Strings
		* Woodwinds
			* Instruments made of wood or metal; played either blows across open
			  hole or on reeds; tone is produced by a column of air vibrating
			  within a pipe that has holes along its length
			* Carter, Woodwind Quintet, II Allegro giocoso
		* Brass
			* Instruments with a cup-shaped mouth piece and tube that flares
			  into a bell; lip vibration of air in tube; pitch varied by slide
			  or valves;modern instruments often made of brass or silver
			* Pachelbel, Canon
		* Percussion
			* Sound created by striking or rattling the instrument; some
			  instruments have no pixed pitch, other follow regular scales
			* Varese, Ionisation
		* Keyboards
			* Identified by keyboard; sound production differs from striking
			  strings (piano), to vibrating columns of air(Pipe oragn) to 
			  electronic(Synthesizer)
