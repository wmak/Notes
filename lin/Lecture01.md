## What makes Language unique?
* Arbitrariness
	* The relationship between object and word is arbitrary
	* They are not named after the objects properties
* Creativity
	* In spite of Arbitrariness of linguistic signs humans can produce never
	  before heard sentences
	* But at the same time creativity is regulated by systematic constraint. ie
	  innovation occurs within boundaries set by rules
	* A given language only has a certain specific number of sounds and allows
	  these sounds to combine in certain specific ways.
	* This means that their are a finite set of words, yet there are an infinite
	  number of possible sentences.
* Displacement
	* Language allows us to talk about things that are not present

## Linguistic Knowledge
* Language is a complex system
* One of it's concepts is Grammar

### Grammar
* Two types:
	* Prescriptive
		* The should and should nots of a language
	* Descriptive
		* Doesn't bring any preconceived notinos of correctness to the task or
		  favors the language as one group as being somehow better
* A complex system of rules that governs how speakers organize sounds into words
  and words into sentences
* Components
	* Phonetics
	* Phonology
	* Morphology
	* Syntax
	* Semantics
* Characteristics
	* Generality
	* Parity - all grammers are equal.
	* Mutability - change over time
	* Inaccessibility - is unconscious and cannot be figured out
	* Universality - grammars are alike in basic ways
* Universal Grammar
	* Linguists have noticed that all grammars have similiarties at a basic
	  level
	* This is the main concept ot Universal Grammar
		* The laws and rules that pertain to all human languages
* Mental Grammar
	* Information about sounds
		* Their are certain sounds that can only occur in certain positions in our
		  language.
		* We know which sounds occur in our language.
	* Certain sequences of sounds correspond to certain meanings
		* The correspondence between a sequence of sounds and a meaning is
		  stored in a speaker's mental lexicon
