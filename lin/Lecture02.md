## Phonetics: the study of sounds
* We begin with examining the minimal units of language
* This subfield is called *phonetics*
* There are two basic ways of analyzing the speech sounds(**phones**)
	* *Articulatory phonetics*
		* Examining the physiological mechanisms of speech production
	* *Acoustic phonetics*
		* Measuring and analyzing he physical properties of the sound waves
		  produced in speech
* English is terrible with it's representation of sound.
	* r<b>ough</b> vs thr<b>ough</b> vs th<b>ough</b>
* In order to overcome this issue a universal system has been devised
* This is known as the **International Phonetic Alphabet** (**IPA**)
* It's purpose is to represent each sound of human speech with a single symbol
	* A one to one correspondence.
	* These symbols are enclosed into square brackets.

## Phonetic Transcription
* In english the sound spelled as <b>th</b> (ie in <b>th</b>is or <b>th</b>at)
  is transcribed using &#240; 
* phones are split into three major classes
	* Vowels
	* Consonants
	* Glides
* The phones in these classes can be further distinguished based on their
  articulation properties
	* The placement of the tongue and the position of the lips are the crucial
	  factors.

### The Tongue
* Primary Articulation organ
* Extremely mobile.
* **Labial**
	* *Bilabial* sounds [m] [p] [b].
		* Sounds produced with the two lips.
		* ex. <b>m</b>it, <b>p</b>it, and <b>b</b>it
	* *labiodentals* sounds [f] and [v]
		* sounds produced with the lip and the teeth.
		* ex. <b>f</b>ish and <b>v</b>est
* **Dental and Interdental**
	* *Interdental* sound [&#240;]
		* sound porduced with the tongue between the teeth
	* *Dental* is anything to do with the teeth.
* **Alveolars**
	* Sounds where the tongue moves to the alveolar ridge
	* We call these sounds alveolar.
	* These symbols
		* [n], [t], [d], [s], [z], [l]
	* Exmaples
		* nip, tip, dig, sip, zip, lip
* **Alveopalatal**
	* Sounds where the tongue moves right behind the alveolar ridge
	* These symbols
		* [&#658;] and [&#643;]
* **Velar**
	* Sounds further back in the mouth
	* These sounds are called velars 
		* [&#331;], [k], [g]
	* Examples
		* Sing, Stick, Twig
* **Uvular**
	* Sounds at the very back of the throat
	* English does not have a sound pronounced here
* **Glottal**
	* sounds produced using the vocal folds
	* Examples
		* Heave, Hog, Better, Bottle
