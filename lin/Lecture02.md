## Phonetics: the study of sounds
* We begin with examining the minimal units of language
* This subfield is called *phonetics*
* There are two basic ways of analyzing the speech sounds(**phones**)
	* *Articulatory phonetics*
		* Examining the physiological mechanisms of speech production
	* *Acoustic phonetics*
		* Measuring and analyzing he physical properties of the sound waves
		  produced in speech
* English is terrible with it's representation of sound.
	* r<b>ough</b> vs thr<b>ough</b> vs th<b>ough</b>
* In order to overcome this issue a universal system has been devised
* This is known as the **International Phonetic Alphabet** (**IPA**)
* It's purpose is to represent each sound of human speech with a single symbol
	* A one to one correspondence.
	* These symbols are enclosed into square brackets.

## Phonetic Transcription
* In english the sound spelled as <b>th</b> (ie in <b>th</b>is or <b>th</b>at)
  is transcribed using &#240; 
* phones are split into three major classes
	* Vowels
	* Consonants
	* Glides
* The phones in these classes can be further distinguished based on their
  articulation properties
	* The placement of the tongue and the position of the lips are the crucial
	  factors.

### The Tongue
* Primary Articulation organ
* Extremely mobile.
* **Labial**
	* *Bilabial* sounds [m] [p] [b].
		* Sounds produced with the two lips.
		* ex. <b>m</b>it, <b>p</b>it, and <b>b</b>it
	* *labiodentals* sounds [f] and [v]
		* sounds produced with the lip and the teeth.
		* ex. <b>f</b>ish and <b>v</b>est
* **Dental and Interdental**
	* *Interdental* sound [&#240;] and [&#952;]
		* sound porduced with the tongue between the teeth
	* *Dental* is anything to do with the teeth.
* **Alveolars**
	* Sounds where the tongue moves to the alveolar ridge
	* We call these sounds alveolar.
	* These symbols
		* [n], [t], [d], [s], [z], [l]
	* Exmaples
		* <b>n</b>ip, <b>t</b>ip, <b>d</b>ig, <b>s</b>ip, <b>z</b>ip, <b>l</b>ip
* **Alveopalatal**
	* Sounds where the tongue moves right behind the alveolar ridge
	* These symbols
		* [&#658;] and [&#643;]
	* Examples
		* <b>sh</b>ip, mea<b>s</b>ure, <b>ch</b>ip, <b>j</b>u<b>dg</b>e
* **Velar**
	* Sounds further back in the mouth
	* These sounds are called velars 
		* [&#331;], [k], [g]
	* Examples
		* Si<b>ng</b>, Sti<b>ck</b>, Twi<b>g</b>
* **Uvular**
	* Sounds at the very back of the throat
	* English does not have a sound pronounced here
* **Glottal**
	* sounds produced using the vocal folds
	* Examples
		* Heave, Hog, Better, Bottle

### Manner of articulation
* Another basic distinction in the manner of articulationo
* When sound is cut off from the nasal passages **oral** sounds are produced.
* **nasal** 
	* sounds are articulated when the velum is lowered and air passes
	  through the nasal passages.
	* For example [n] is nasal while [t] is not (can, cat)
* **stops** 
	* sounds are produced by stopping airflow.
	* Examples
		* [t], [t], [k], [b], [d], [g], [m], [n], [&#331;]
		* bi<b>t</b> and bi<b>d</b>
* **continuants**
	* The airflow of the mouth is not stopped
	* Examples
		* [s], [z]
		* fi<b>tt</b>ing vs fi<b>zz</b>ing
* **fricatives**
	* Noisy friction on air
	* English Fricatives
		* [f], [&#952;], [s], [&#643;], [h], [v], [&#240;], [z], [&#658;]
* **afficates**
	* Producing a stop which is immediately followed by a slow release of the
	  closure.
	* English only has two Affricates
		* [t&#643;] like in <b>ch</b>ur<b>ch</b>
		* [d&#658;] like in <b>j</b>u<b>dge</b>
* **Stridents/Sibilants**
	* The nosier fricatives are called stridents
		* [s] or [z]
	* the quieter ones are known as non-stridents
		* [&#952;] or [&#240;]
* **Liquids**
	* [l] like in **liquids**
	* there's also a dark l or velarized l
		* represented with &#820;l
