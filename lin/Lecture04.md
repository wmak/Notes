## Phonology Part I

### Phonetics and Phonology
* Phonetics is explaining the mechanisms of sound production
* While Phonology determines the selection of speech sounds and governs both the
  sounds patterns and the systematic phonetic variation
	* The sound patterns of languae
	* Study of how sounds combine and pattern together
* Phonology operates at a different level too
	* The **Feature**
	* The **Segment**
	* The **Syllable**
* Examines the connection between sound and meaning
	* Sounds changing can result in meaning changes
	* Segments in contrast -- being distinct or in opposition
		* [sIp] and [zIp] s and z contrast as the sound changes, so does the
		  meaning.
* Minimal Pair
	* Determining whether sounds contrast in a specific language or not.
	* loose vs lose
		* [lus] vs [luz]
	* Based on sound *not* spelling
	* Phonetic context is known as the environment.
* Phonemes
	* Segments that contrast with each other.
	* **Notation**
		* **Phones** -> []
		* **Phonemes** -> //
	* Two sounds are seperate phonemes if you can find a minimal pair to
	  distinguish them
		* [pin] vs [bin]
			* /p/ and /b/ are contrastive based on these pairs
* Allophones
	* Two sounds in complementary distribution
	* determined by the language
	* For example in english
		* ben and ban have different meanings and their distinguished by
		* [b&#603;n] and [b&#230;n]
	* Meanwhile both sounds in Turkish mean 'I'
	* As well sounds that do not contrast in english may be distinct in other
	  languages.
