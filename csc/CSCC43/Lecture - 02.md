# Lecture 02

## ER modelling
	* Traingle = a subclass relationship.
	* Underline = A key.
		* Keys are also inherited.
	* Don't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the problems that come with that

## Keys
	* *Minimal Key*: A key with as few attributes possible
	* *Superkey*: !MinimalKey.
	* With n attributes, and k keys what is the maximum number of super keys
	  that you can have?
		* 2^{n-k}
