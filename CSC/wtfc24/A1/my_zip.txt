The use of lists in python seemed like the best choice, If I wanted to extend
it to accepting multiple inputs ie 3 lists instead of just two it would be 
extroidinarily easy. As well I find python's list functions much easier to
use compared to it's pairs. Which would have been my second choice


I used LinkedLists in java cause it seemed like the closest thing to python's
List type which made converting it much easier.
