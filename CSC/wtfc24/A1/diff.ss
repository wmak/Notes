(module diff scheme
 ; a Scheme procedure (differentiate expr var), which takes two arguments:
 ; Ô¨Årst, the formula to be differentiated (in the list representation 
 ; described above); and second, the variable with respect to which the
 ; differentiation will be done, as a symbol. The function will return the 
 ; partial derivative, also in the list representation.
