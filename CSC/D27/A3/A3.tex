\section{So, You Want to be a Hacker?}
\begin{enumerate}[A]
	\item
		If the marker had not turned off the default stack-protector and the the
		user enters a string over certain length then they would observe an
		error stating:
		\begin{verbatim}
		*** stack smashing detected ***: ./marker terminated
		======= Backtrace: =========
		\end{verbatim}\\
		etc...
	\item
		The string values I used were:
		\begin{verbatim}
		Name: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiz
		Mark: hi
		Rubric: hellooooooooo
		\end{verbatim}\\
		The important part of the Name variable are the last two characters.
		This is because the $34^{th}$ character causes an overflow to occur. An
		overflow occurs because the way auth and name are stored causes auth to 
		be 60 bytes away so we can just set it to 'iz'
	\item
		No. In this particular case it would have been protected. Because the
		user would write in the opposite direction from auth. But if 
		'char name[34]` came before `int auth=0` then it would still be 
		possible.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Wifi Router Vulnerabilities}
\begin{enumerate}[A]
	\item
		For this attack as an attacker I would first use db-ip.com to find all
		possible Canadian addresses if I knew about this vulnerability with
		Bell. Or if the screenshot is from his router then I would know that I
		can go on 76.65.189.43. 
		Then I would use netcat to figure out which ports are open and see
		which of them allow me to login with the authenticate
		request(http://192.168.2.1/login?u=admin&p=admin). The ones that do I
		would then send a new DNS server. With my new DNS server I would have
		the google ip redirect to my kim.dot.com.
	\item
		Sitting outside of the professor's condo the attacker would be able to
		send TCP packets to the router with a different source address. And
		because the attacker would be right next to the router their address
		would remain unchanged. Now the attacker can send the same requests as
		before and modify the DNS 
	\item
		A hacker could very easily inject some malicious javascript into
		youvyou.com that would authenticate with the administrative account. And
		then aftewards modify the DNS server yet again to set google to be
		kim.dot.com
\end{enumerate}
