\begin{enumerate}[A]
\item
    \begin{enumerate}[i]
		\item Eve will not know enough information to decipher any future
			messages between Alice and Bob
        \item No this scheme is insecure against Mallory she would be able to
			modify $g^a mod p$ or $g^b mod p$ with her own values. Alice and Bob
			will still be able to send messages between each other but Mallory
			would also be able to read them.
    \end{enumerate}
\item
    \begin{enumerate}[i]
        \item Yes this will be secure against Eve, even though she can see the
			public keys this is not enough for her to decipher any of the
			messages.
        \item No Mallory could insert her own public key instead of either or
			both Alice and Bob's keys. In this case her own private key would be
			able to decipher any future messages.
    \end{enumerate}
\item
    \begin{enumerate}[i]
        \item Yes, there's absolutely nothing Eve can do to read the messages
			between Alice and Bob.
        \item Yes, Even if Mallory knew their public keys she wouldn't be able
			to read the messages or create her own.
    \end{enumerate}
\item
    \begin{enumerate}[i]
        \item Yes, there's absolutely nothing Eve can do to read the messages
			between Alice and Bob.
        \item Yes, Mallory would not be able to do anything to the messages
			betwwen Alice and Bob.
        \item Yes, In the very unlikely case that Mallory can brute force either
			of their private keys in the previous case she would be able to
			modify messages between Alice and Bob. But in this case she would
			have less than a day to brute force the key and she would only be
			able to modify messages for one day.
