	The concept of Cybernetic Organisms becoming common place is something out
of science fiction, but as technology progresses this will eventually become a 
reality. With this comes some issues. Can we rely on our cybernetic implants,
the implications of having two types of people; those augmented and those who
are not, and can we still call ourselves human after we would have changed so 
much.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
    The number of people with access to technology is increasing, thanks to 
companies like Google with their project Loon more people are able to get onto
the Internet. Or with companies like Xiaomi which seek to provide cheaper
affordable cellphones for everyone. If this trend of technological advancement 
continues then the possibility of Cybernetic Organisms or Cyborgs will become an
even more viable possibility. While Cybernetic enhancements could potentially be
extremely beneficial to everyone involved, giving them increased physical and
mental capabilities. There are a multitude of issues that will exist and already
exist if Cybernetics become just as common as cellphones or the Internet.
\\\\
    The first topic explored here will be the reliability of Cybernetics. As
we've discussed in class technology cannot be one hundred percent reliable, and 
are at times much worse than that. An easy example of this would be Therac-25
where in at least six patients were involved with massive overdoses of radiation.
Given the dangers with badly created software and hardware that already exist
today. When these issues are applied to something that is so closely tied with
our bodies they're severely amplified. For example there already exists
technology to return sight for those who have lost it. The issue then arises 
where these people are now doing something potentially dangerous which is
dependent on their sight. If their implant malfunctions or presents them with 
false information then lives will be lost.
\\\\
    Another issue is that of Security with the convenience of something like a
memory implant storing things such as our banking information would be very
convenient. But this also means that someone like a cracker would be very likely
to try to get into our implants. At the same time with things like artificial
limbs to give increased strength if someone could control these then we would be
at risk at becoming someones puppet.
\\\\
    The next topic will be on the implications on having two types of people;
those augmented and those who are not. In a world where people will begin to
enhance themselves improving things such as memory or response times those who
cannot afford or do not want these enhancements will be left behind. For
example when an employer has the choice between someone who can remember more 
and think faster because of cybernetic implants versus someone who cannot it is
very clear who is more likely to be hired. This then raises the issue of whether
there should be regulations on cybernetic implants, whether the government
should decide to restrict people on what enhancements they can have. 
\\\\
    Another issue is on the humanity of cybernetic implants, more specifically
when one has changed so much of themselves can they still be called human. This
concept can be compared to the Theseus paradox. Starting with a ship, or a
person in this case. If you replaced each plank piece by piece such that the
resulting ship no longer contains any of the original wood, whether it still be
considered the same ship. If it is no longer the same ship at which point does
it cease to be the same ship. In this case if you start with a person and
replace every organic part of them with a cybernetic implant would one still
call them human.
\\\\\
    All in all Cybernetics come with a world of benefits. Space travel would be
easier if we needed less oxygen, we would be much more productive if we had an
encyclopedia of information in our minds rather than at our fingertips. But
these benefits come with complications and how we as a species handle these
complications will influence how we shape our next technological revolution.

\section{Safety}
The safety of humans and animals that might interact with cybernetics is an
extremely important issue. We know from our own history with new technology that
they can be hazardous when not dealt with properly. For example from class we
know about the MIM-104 Patriot missiles, that because of a software bug causing
a drift in it's system clock. This drift caused a failure in the system to
locate and intercept incoming missiles. From our experience with technology we
know that there is no way for any of them to be bug free. So especially with a
technology that will so closely be attached to our bodies whether or not this
technology should be developed is a very difficult question.
\\\\
The benefits of becoming Cybernetic Organisms are still being explored. For
example the field of Transhumanism\cite{Transhumanism} though relatively new
explores this concept of Cybernetic Organisms replacing humans quite in depth.
Transhumanism is a movement motivated to transforming humanity, by making
technologies that improve human intelligence, as well as their physical and
psychological capacities. We're steadily approaching something close to what
these Transhumanists are dreaming of. If one was to look at the state of
technology that we have with us this isn't too far off. Our cellphones started
as devices that allowed us to talk with people far away.  But have since then
extended far past that capability. Nowadays we carry devices with us that are
constantly connected to the Internet which can be a vast encyclopedia of
information, constantly at the fingertips of everyone.  And this has even
expanded past that we're seeing the rise of wearable technologies. With things
like smart watches, optical head-mounted displays and wearable computers. These
technologies are making humans all the more connected with computers and because
of that we're becoming ever dependent on them.
\\\\
And already with these current technologies we're seeing how problematic it is
if they're not built properly. For example there are multiple cases over the
past few years of people's cellphones exploding in their pockets \cite{exploding
cellphone}. With these cases the issue was that the person who was injured used
cheap replicas of more expensive phones. Which in the case of cybernetic
implants is entirely a possibility. We know from experience that not everyone
can afford the newest and most up to date technologies. But they still want
them, so people go out and buy cheaper versions. Without nearly as much safety
checks and quality assurances as their more expensive counterparts. When this is
done with components that people will integrate with their bodies the dangers
are even higher. For example say a new cybernetic arm was released that allowed
workers to lift extremely heavy weights with ease. But a bug was introduced that
caused it to move around chaotically. Potentially this could put many workers in
danger. And a bug like this isn't that uncommon, Le magazine de la sant\'{e} had
an interview with a man whose arm did exactly that. 
\\\\
There are many risks that come with allowing humanity to become cybernetic
organisms. And whether these risks are worth it will be up for us to decide.
It's very likely that we will need to have a new level of quality assurance for
these devices. If they're not properly maintained and checked after then they
are an even bigger risk than current the technology we currently have.


\section{Security}
Every year a copious amount of security flaws are discovered and raised. This
year alone we've seen Heartbleed\cite{Heartbleed} a major bug in OpenSSL that
affected millions of websites. Which of course affected millions more users.
There was also Shellshock\cite{Shellshock} a major issue in bash that allowed
attackers to execute any command they wished on their targets. These issues are
even riskier when applied to cybernetic implants. For example one of the
earliest technologies developed by researchers is known as Brain-Computer
interfaces. Research on this technology began in 1970 but by 1990 prototypes
have already been implanted in humans. One of the things that these researchers
were able to do was to restore vision to a man who had non-congenital
blindness\cite{sight}.
