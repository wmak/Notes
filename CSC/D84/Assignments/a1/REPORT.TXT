 I certify that I have read the UTSC code on academic
honesty and plaguarism. All work submitted as part
of this assignment is my own.

(-5 marks for failing to provide the identifying
 information requested above)
________________________________________________

Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (1 marks) Of BFS and DFS, which search algorithm yields
     the best results? (i.e. which is more likely
     to get the mouse to the cheese safely before
     being eaten?)


2 .- (1 marks) Does this mean that in general BFS is a better
     search algorithm? (yes/no and give reasons to
     support your answer based on your observations)


3 .- (2 marks) Describe the heuristic function you used for
     A* search. Why is this heuristic admissible?


4 .- (1 marks) Explain how your heuristic function accounts for
     the presence of multiple cheeses.


5 .- (1 marks) Is A* equivalent to BFS for this problem? or is
     it better/worse? explain your answer based on 
     your observations.

6 .- (2 marks) Describe your heuristic function for A*-nokitty.
     How does it work? what factors are considered
     into the cost function? is it admissible?

7 .- (2 marks) What is the largest limitation of the search
     algorithms implemented in this assignment?
     (i.e. is there anything we are missing that
      could lead to a smarter mouse?) - this is
     a more or less open question, but we talked 
     about it in lecture!

Mark with an 'x' where appropriate. If something is only
working partially, briefly describe what works, what
doesn't work, or what problems exist.

Marking:

(5 marks) Correctly implementing BFS - the search
          runs and produces the expected search
          behaviour.

(5 marks) Correctly implementing DFS - the search
          runs and produces the expected behaviour.

(5 marks)  A* cost function is implemented, reasonable,
           and admissible.

(10 marks) Correctly implementing A* search - the search
           runs and produces the expected behaviour.

(10 marks) Implemented a **clever**  A*-nokitty heuristic
           and a working A*-nokitty search. The search
           should produce a smarter mouse than all of
           BFS/DFS/vanilla A*.

           The heuristic should accounts for known game 
           factors that affect the mouse's chance of success.

           (to be marked competitively - smartest mouse
            in the class earns full marks)

(10 marks) Answers in this report file

(up to 15 marks) Assigned by the TA based on how smart your
		 mouse actually is. Mind what is going on in
		 the game, and think about how to make your
		 mouse most likely to win!
