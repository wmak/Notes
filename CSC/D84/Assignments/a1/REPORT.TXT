Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (1 marks) Of BFS and DFS, which search algorithm yields
     the best results? (i.e. which is more likely
     to get the mouse to the cheese safely before
     being eaten?)
	 
 	 Definitely BFS, BFS will always find the closest cheese and go towards it,
	 meanwhile DFS will find an the first cheese in a clockwise direction and
	 run towards that.


2 .- (1 marks) Does this mean that in general BFS is a better
     search algorithm? (yes/no and give reasons to
     support your answer based on your observations)

	 No this does not mean that in general BFS is a better search algorithm,
	 What this means is that in the case where you a mouse in a maze and you use
	 your telepathy to choose a path, don't use DFS because you will probably
	 take a bad route.


3 .- (2 marks) Describe the heuristic function you used for
     A* search. Why is this heuristic admissible?

	 I used the manhattan distance between the current node and the cheese. This
	 heuristic is admissible since in a maze the shortest distance between the
	 two points will be this distance.


4 .- (1 marks) Explain how your heuristic function accounts for
     the presence of multiple cheeses.
	
	 By only counting the cheese that is the closest since it wouldn't make
	 sense to go for the further cheeses


5 .- (1 marks) Is A* equivalent to BFS for this problem? or is
     it better/worse? explain your answer based on 
     your observations.

	 A* is defintely better than BFS this is easily seen in how efficently it
	 can find the route between the two points.

6 .- (2 marks) Describe your heuristic function for A*-nokitty.
     How does it work? what factors are considered
     into the cost function? is it admissible?

	 My function maintains the original calculation for the cheese but will now
	 find the distance to all the cats and use that to determine which direction
	 to go to avoid the cats. As well by using junkpile i've also determined
	 when the mouse has eaten the red cheese that makes it invincible. At which
	 point the mouse will ignore the cats completely and use the original A star
	 to go straight at the cheese.

7 .- (2 marks) What is the largest limitation of the search
     algorithms implemented in this assignment?
     (i.e. is there anything we are missing that
      could lead to a smarter mouse?) - this is
     a more or less open question, but we talked 
     about it in lecture!

	 That it only takes the locations of other objects into account. A smarter
	 AI could try to attempt to predict where the cats will go to outsmart them.
	 Even better a smarter AI would have a strategy in place rather than just
	 going straight for the cheese

Marking:

(5 marks) Correctly implementing BFS - the search
          runs and produces the expected search
          behaviour.

(5 marks) Correctly implementing DFS - the search
          runs and produces the expected behaviour.

(5 marks)  A* cost function is implemented, reasonable,
           and admissible.

(10 marks) Correctly implementing A* search - the search
           runs and produces the expected behaviour.

(10 marks) Implemented a **clever**  A*-nokitty heuristic
           and a working A*-nokitty search. The search
           should produce a smarter mouse than all of
           BFS/DFS/vanilla A*.

           The heuristic should accounts for known game 
           factors that affect the mouse's chance of success.

           (to be marked competitively - smartest mouse
            in the class earns full marks)

(10 marks) Answers in this report file

(up to 15 marks) Assigned by the TA based on how smart your
		 mouse actually is. Mind what is going on in
		 the game, and think about how to make your
		 mouse most likely to win!
