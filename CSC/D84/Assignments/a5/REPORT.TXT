Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

Note: Empirically, I have had success with the following parameters:

    Learning rates in [2,6], threshold in [.01, .05] for 1-layer
     networks

    Learninng rates in [.25,10], threshold in [.01, .05] for 2-layer
     networks

    For 2-layer networks, I have seen good results with 15-30 hidden
     units

    You will have to try and see what works best for each network
     architecture. 

1 .- (2.5 marks) Train a 1-layer network using the Logistic activation
               function. 

		Report the learning rate used: 0.8
		Report the threshold used: 0.011

		Train the network with 3 different random seeds,
		for each seed report:

		List of seeds used: 1236, 2222, 12

		Average classification accuracy on training set: 93.6698927544,
93.6698927544, 94.0622547737
		Average classification accuracy on testing set: 91.8753478019,
91.8196994992, 91.9309961046

		Save a screenshot of the trained network, call your
		file:

		 	1layer-­logistic-­final.jpg 

2 .- (2.5 marks) Repeat the process above but using a 1-layer network
		with hyperbolic tangent activation function.

		Report the learning rate used: 0.88
		Report the threshold used: 0.035

		For the 3 random seeds report: 

		List of seeds used: 1234

		Average classification accuracy on training set: 94.6900340047,
94.2191995815, 94.0360973058
		Average classification accuracy on testing set: 92.877017251,
91.7640511964, 92.7657206455

		Save a screenshot of the trained network, call your
		file:

			1layer-tanh-final.jpg

3 .- (2.5 marks) Repeat the process above using a 2-layer network
		with hyperbolic tangent activation function.

		Report the learning rate used: 0.10
		Report the threshold used: 0.035
		Number of hidden units: 15

		For the 3 random seeds report:

		List of seeds used: 2222, 22, 21

		Average classification accuracy on training set: 94.2715145174,
93.4344755428, 93.931467434
		Average classification accuracy on testing set: 91.3745130774,
91.4858096828, 91.5971062883

		Save a screenshot of the trained network, call your
		file:

4 .- (2.5 marks) Repeat the process above using a 2-layer network
		with logistic activation function.

		Report the learning rate used: 8
		Report the threshold used: 0.012
		Number of hidden units: 20

		For the 3 random seeds report:

		List of seeds used: 21, 2122, 51234

		Average classification accuracy on training set: 84.2532042898,
83.6269269315, 84.1685215790
		Average classification accuracy on testing set: 80.244852532,
79.5820387176, 80.3865829193

		Save a screenshot of the trained network, call your
		file:
		
			2layer-logistic-final.jpg

5 .- (5 marks) Which network architecture (number of layers/type of
	       activation function) performs best, and why?
		I found a 2 layer hyperbolic performed best. The hardest part about
setting the network parameters was to set the threshold which just took
watching the network's squared error and looking for when it stabilized.

6 .- (10 marks) Describe how you would build a network to play the cat
	        and mouse game (move the mouse to help it survive).

		- Describe what the input is in terms of a vector of
		  values
		I would do a feature vector. The locations of each cat, the cheese and
the mouse. As well as the distances to between each of these and the number of
walls.
		- Describe what the output layer looks like (how many
		  neurons and what they encode)
		1. Whether the mouse survived
		2. The number of cheese left
		3. Distance to the cats
		- Describe the error function
		I would have the error function be dependent on whether or not the mouse
survives since this is the most important feature
		- How many layers should you use?
		From this assignment I would have 2 layers for simplicity and because it
seems to perform better
