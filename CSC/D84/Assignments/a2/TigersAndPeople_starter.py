# CSC D84 - Non-deterministic programming example
#
# Let us try to move a set of N tigers and M people across a river
#
# Your task is to use the functions provided by this starter file.
# 
# ** You can only modify the function called 'SearchForPlan'
# ** Do not touch any other part of the starter code, as we
# ** may replace and swap components for testing. Your solution
# ** must not depend on details of how the calls provided to
# ** you are implemented.
#
# Now, go move some tigers across the river!
#
# Starter: F.J.E. Dec. 2014

	## TO DO:
	##   Add your search code below. Mind the following constraints:
	##    You are not to use graph search to come up with your plan (i.e. you 
	##      are not allowed to solve the problem in order to solve the problem!)
	##    You are not allowed to call commands directly. All actions must be
	##      part of the plan you are searching for
	##    You are not allowed to hardcode the solution for a given N and M
	##	(yes, I know you can solve the problem in your head. So can I. We
	##	 are studying how non-deterministic-programming works. So work
	##	 with it and learn!)
	##    You are not allowed to change or update the contents of:
	##		Left_Side
	##		Right_Side
	##		Boat
	##		creatures
	##		tries
	##    The simplest plan generation method will find a solution - given enough
	##	time. But you should aim for a smarter search process that does not
	##	require a ridiculous amount of search.
	##
	##    You can choose to use recursion, or not. As you please. But explain your
	##	choice in the report.
