Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

For experiment 1)

	- What is the average cost of the initial solution (average over all runs)?

	- What is the average cost of the final solution over your five runs?

	- Does the number of input points have a strong
          influence on the final location of the medians?
          (i.e. are the solutions all similar and reasonable? or do they change wildly?)

For experiment 2)

	- Record the initial seed values used:
	
	- What is the average initial cost over all runs?

	- What is the average final cost over all runs?

	- What is the *range* of the final cost values over all runs?

	- Is the search stable? (i.e. does the initial random
          seed strongly influence the result?

For experiment 3)

	- What are the final costs for each temperature?

	- Does the temperature have a strong influence on the goodness
          of the final solution?

For experiment 4)

	- What are the final costs for each decay factor?

	- Does the decay factor strongly influence the goodness of the
	  final solution?

From 3) and 4)

	- What is the average final cost for the experiments in 3)?

	- What is the average final cost for the experiments in 4)?

	- What is the *best* solution found either in 3) or 4)? (what is its cost?)

	- Does deterministic annealing (with suitable temperature and
	  decay) improve the results over standard local search?
	  if so, by how much? (in % please)

From 5) and 6)
	
	- Record the initial seeds used:

	- Record the final solution cost for your three DA runs

	- Record the final solution cost for simple local search

	- Overall, does DA improve the solution in a meaningful way?
	  (give the largest observed % improvement, whether it 
           is positive or negative)
	  Use the average final cost for DA here

From 1) through 6)

	- Does local search produce reasonably good results on this
	  problem?

	- Is Deterministic Annealing worth the extra computation time
	  on this particular problem?

For 7) and 8)

	- Record the initial seeds used for DA:

	- Record the final cost for the solutions found by DA

	- Record the final cost of the local search solution

	- What is the % improvement (positive or negative) of the
	  DA solutions compared to the local search solutions?
	  Use the average final cost for DA here.

Finally:

	- How would you modify the cost function so that, instead
	  of simple Euclidean distance from a point on the GTA
	  map to one of the possible restaurant locations, your
          cost considers the time it would take to travel from
          that point to the closest restaurant?

	  We need a well thought answer, not a vague statement.

Marking:

(10 marks) Correctly implementing local search - it
           progressively improves results and yields
           a reasonable final solution.

(15 marks) Correctly implementing Deterministic
           Annealing. The search can explore states
           that appear worse, but eventually reaches
           a reasonable solution. Temperature
           decay is managed appropriately

(30 marks) The answers in this report

(15 marks) Correctly solving the tigers and people
	   non-deterministic programming task
