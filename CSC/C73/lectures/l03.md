# Minimum Spanning Trees(MST)
* Input: Undirected, connected graph G=(V, E), with edge weight function w: E \to
R
* Output: min weight spanning tree of G, ie. a spanning tree T* of G s.t. \forall
  spannign tree T of G, w(T*) <= w(T)
* A (free) tree is an undirected, connected, acyclic graph.
* Facts:
	1. A tree with n nodes has n-1 edges.
	2. A connected graph with n nodes and n-1 edges is a tree
	3. If we add an edge to a tree we create an unique cycle, if we remove any
	   edge from that cycle we get back a tree.
* A Spanning tree of g=(v, E) is a tree that contains all the nodes of G & a
  subset of its edges.
	* w(T) = sum of weights of edges of T
* Cut of graph G=(V, E) is a partition of V into S \subset V and S^_ = V-S Edge
  (u,v) crosses hte cut if one edpoint is in S and the other is in S^_
* Let:
	* G=(V, E) be an undirected connected graph
	* F \subset E contained in some MST of G
	* (S, S^_) is a cut st no e \in F crosses it
	* e is any min weight edge crossing cut
* Then F u {e} is contained in some MST of G
* Let T* be MST that contains all the edges in F
* If T* contains e, done
* If T* does not contain e then T* contains some edge say e' that crosses (S,
  S^_)
* Add e to T* this creates an unique cycle that must contain e'. now remove e'
  from that cycle I am left with a tree again(Fact 3)
* w(T) = w(T*) + w(e) - w(e') <= w(T*)
	* => T is alsoa  MST and contains F u {e}
# Kruskal's MST algorithm
* Put all edges in heap H, by weight F := 0
* while |F| <= |v| -1 do
	e:=extractmin(H)
	if endgoints of e are not ocnnected via a path that uses only edges in F
then F:= F u {e}
return F
# Prim's MST algorithm
* Let s be an arbitrary node
* R:={s}; F:= 0
* while R!=V do
	let (u, v) be min-wt edge st u\inR, v\notin R
	R:= Ru{v}; F := F u {(u,v)}
return F
