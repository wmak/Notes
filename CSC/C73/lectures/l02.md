# Huffman coeds
* Input: (Gamma, f)
* Output: Binary tree T representing a code for Gamma that is optimal for f
* Optimal === Sum f(a) * depth<sub>T</sub>(a)
* Easy observations
	1. An optimal tree must be full
	2. In an optimal tree T, f(x) > f(y) => depth<sub>T</sub>(x) <= depth<sub>T</sub>(x)
	* 1,2 => if x, y \in Gamma are symbols have smallest frequencies then there
	  is an optimal tree in which x,y are siblings and are at max depth
* Huffman's algorithm
	* Create leaves for all symbols
	* find two least frequent symbols x and y; make these siblings of a new node
	  u and replace them with a new combined symbol z with requency f(x) + f(y)
	* recursively construct optimal tree for (Gamma - {x, y}) U {z} and adjusted
	  frequencies
	* Recursion ends when i have two symbols A and B.
* (Gamma, f) input
	* H = tree produced for (Gamma, f)
	* x, y are min frequency elements, siblings at lowest level
	* Gamma' = (Gamma - {x, y}) u {z}
	* f'(a) = {f(a) if a (- Gamma - {x, y}, f(x) + f(y) if a = z}
	* H' could be produced by algorithm for (Gamma', f') => H' is optimal for
	  (Gamma', f') by IH
* T = optimal tree for (Gamma, f) by earlier observation can assume WLOG that in
  T x and y are siblings at bottom level
* WAD(H) = WAD(H') + f(x) + f(y)
	* <= WAD(T') + f(x) + f(y) [by opt of H']
	* = WAD(T)
	* Therefore H is optimal too
## Running time of Hoffman algorithm
* Using heaps we can implement this in O(nlogn) time.

#Dijkstra's shortest paths algo
* Weighted (di)graph
* G = (V, E), w(e) = weight of e, where e (- E
* Assume (for now): w(e) >= 0
* w(path) = Sum of the weights of every e in path
* Input: G = (V, E) w: E -> R<sup>+</sup><sub>O</sub>, s (- V
* Output: \forall u \in V, d(u) = weight of shortest s-> u path
* Suppose we have set of nodes R st
	1. \forall u, u' (- V if u (- R and u' \notin  R then d-(u) <= d-(u')
	2. for every u (- R there is a shortest s-> u path where all nodes are in R
	* Also suppose that for each u(-V we have computed
		* d<sub>R</sub> = weight of shortes R-path
		* infinity if no such path exists
* Note
	* \forall u \in R, d_R(u) = d-(u)
	* \forall u \notin R, d_R(u) >= d-(u)
* Idea: Greedily expand R until it covers all nodes
	* How to start?:
	1. R = {s}
	2. d<sub>R</sub>(u) = u if u=s, w(e) if (s,u) (- E, infinity otherwise
* how to greedily expand R?
	* Pick v \notin R st d_r(v) is min
	* Breaks ties arbitrarily
	* Claim: D<sub>r</sub>(v) = d-(v) [even though v \notin r]
* d-(v) = w(P')
= w(P_1) + w(P_2)
>= d_R(v') + w(P_2)
>= d_R(v) + w(P_2)
>= d_R(v)
= w(P)
* What about u \notin R'?
	* A: if (v, u) \notin E then d<sub>R'</sub>(u) = d<sub>R</sub>(u)
	* If (v, u) \in E then
	* d<sub>R'</sub> = min( d<sub>R</sub>(u), d<sub>R</sub>(v) + w(v, u))
