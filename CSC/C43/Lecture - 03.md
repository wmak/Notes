# Functional Dependency
* If something is a subset of another it is trivial
	* ie. AB -> B
* Nontrivial if at least one is not among the other
	* ie. AB -> BC
* Completely nontrivial if nothing is shared
	* ie. A -> C

# Keys of relations
* a key *K* for relations R. *K* is a key if:
	1. Uniqueness: K -> all attributes of R
	2. Minimality: AB -> CDE
